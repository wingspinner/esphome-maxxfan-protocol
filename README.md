# esphome-maxxfan-protocol

Maxxfan infrared remote control protocol component for ESPHome.

This component was originally developed for [Minuet](https://github.com/j9brown/minuet), a smart brushless DC motor controller for the [MAXXAIR Maxxfan](https://www.maxxair.com/products/fans/maxxfan-deluxe/).  You can also use it for other projects.

## Configuration

### Including the component

Add this stanza to your ESPHome configuration to pull the `maxxfan_protocol` component from github.

```yaml
# Import the maxxfan protocol component from Github.
external_components:
  - source: github://j9brown/esphome-maxxfan-protocol@main
    components: [ maxxfan_protocol ]

# Enable the Maxxfan protocol.
maxxfan_protocol:
```

### Receiving Maxxfan remote control messages

The remote receiver's `on_maxxfan` event handler receives the [MaxxfanData](components/maxxfan_protocol/maxxfan_protocol.h) object that was parsed from the received message.

Here's what you need to add to your ESPHome configuration to receive Maxxfan messages, assuming you have connected a 38 KHz infrared receiver to pin 2.

```yaml
# Configure the IR receiver.
remote_receiver:
  - id: ir_receiver
    pin:
      number: 2  # Change this to the pin your IR receiver is attached to
      mode: input
      inverted: true
    rmt_channel: 2
    memory_blocks: 2
    dump: maxxfan
    on_maxxfan:
      then:
        lambda: |-
          // The variable 'x' holds a MaxxfanData object parsed from the received message
          ESP_LOGD("maxxfan-example", "Fan state: %s", x.fan_on ? "on" : "off");
```

### Transmitting Maxxfan remote control messages

*Note: The transmitter implementation is currently a work in progress and needs further testing.*

The `remote_transmitter.transmit_maxxfan` transmits a message to the fan and sets all parameters at once.  Any parameters you don't specify in the action will be set to their default values.  All parameters are templatable.

| Parameter        | Value                                                                         | Default |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| fan_on           | Fan state: `true` turns fan on, `false` turns fan off                         | `false` |
| fan_speed        | Fan speed percent: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100                    | `10`    |
| fan_exhaust      | Fan direction: `true` for exhaust, `false` for intake                         | `false` |
| cover_open       | Cover state: `true` for open, `false` for close                               | `false` |
| auto_mode        | Mode: `true` for automatic mode (thermostat control), `false` for manual mode | `false` |
| auto_temperature | Thermostat setpoint in Fahrenheight: range 29 to 99                           | `78`    |
| special          | Special modes: see [protocol details](#protocol-details)                      | `false` |
| warn             | Emit warning tone: `true` to beep twice, `false` to not beep                  | `false` |

Here's what you need to add to your ESPHome configuration to transmit Maxxfan messages, assuming you have connected an infrared LED to pin 10.

```yaml
# Configure the IR transmitter.
remote_transmitter:
  - id: ir_transmitter
    pin:
      number: 10  # Change this to the pin your IR transmitter is attached to
      inverted: false
    carrier_duty_percent: 50%

# When a button is pressed, transmit a message to turn the fan on low speed in exhaust mode.
# Note that each message sets all of the fan's parameters at once.  Any parameters you don't specify
# in the action will be set to their default values.
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    id: example_button
    pin:
      number: 9  # Change this to the pin of a button on your board
      inverted: true
    on_click:
      then:
        - logger.log: "Transmitting message to Maxxfan"
        - remote_transmitter.transmit_maxxfan:
            transmitter_id: ir_transmitter
            fan_on: true
            fan_exhaust: true
            fan_speed: 10
            cover_open: true
            auto_mode: false
            #auto_temperature:
            #special:
            #warn:
```

### Example code

## Protocol details

The Maxxfan IR remote protocol looks like RS232 with 1 start bit (zero), 8 data bits encoded least-significant-bit first, no parity bits, and 2 stop bits (ones). A mark symbol encodes a zero bit and a space symbol encodes a one bit.  Each bit period is 800 us.  The transmission ends with a series of space symbols.

The packet is 16 bytes long and consists of a fixed preamble followed by some control fields and a checksum.

Here's an example of a packet and its decoding:

The *speed* field sets fan speed percentage as a multiple of 10 between 0 and 100 percent inclusively.

The *auto temp* field sets the auto mode thermostat temperature setpoint in the range from 29 to 99 Fahrenheit inclusively.

The *state* field holds a combination of flags as follows (numbered from LSB):

| Bit | Flag            | State | Meaning                                                                                                          |

The meaning of the *special* flag is a bit unclear.  It can be used to detect ceiling fan mode (fan state = 1, special = 1, mode = 0).  Its purpose might be to override the normal behavior of the fan and the cover.  Further experimentation is needed.
